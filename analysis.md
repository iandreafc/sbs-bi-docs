# Analysis
These are the main analyses and reports produced by the software.

## SBS Run

This will calculate the Semantic Brand Score and generate graphical reports, according to the uploaded text file and the chosen parameters.

- Clicking on **Run** will start the analysis, which could take some time. You can exit the app and come back to check the status, or just click on the **Check Status** button. You will receive an email when the analysis end, if this has been set in the parameters.
- When the analysis ends you are able to **download results** and **visualize reports** online. Each report can also be **saved**, as running a new analysis will delete it. Please note that each user has a maximum number of reports that can be saved.
- The analysis can be **stopped** in case of errors.
- Please note that **some graphs** (such as the topic modeling network) are **only visible online**.

### Interpretation of reports
For a comprehensive description of graphs and a full example, please read <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2001/2001.11479.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>.

## Saved Reports

In this page you can see your saved reports and delete those that you do not need anymore. Please consider that every user has a **maximum number of reports** that can be saved. After this limit has been reached, you have to delete old reports in order to save new ones.
